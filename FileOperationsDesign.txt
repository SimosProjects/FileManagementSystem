### System Level Design:

#### 1. Modules:
   - **File System Module:** Responsible for interacting with the underlying file system and providing file-related operations.
   - **Error Handling Module:** Handles errors and exceptions generated during file operations.

#### 2. Classes:

##### a. File System Module:
   - **File**:
     - Represents a file in the file system.
     - Attributes:
       - `filename`: Name of the file.
       - `filepath`: Full path to the file.
     - Methods:
       - `create()`: Creates a new file.
       - `read()`: Reads data from the file.
       - `write(data)`: Writes data to the file.
       - `delete()`: Deletes the file.
   
   - **Directory**:
     - Represents a directory in the file system.
     - Attributes:
       - `dirname`: Name of the directory.
       - `dirpath`: Full path to the directory.
     - Methods:
       - `create()`: Creates a new directory.
       - `listContents()`: Lists the contents of the directory.
       - `delete()`: Deletes the directory.

##### b. Error Handling Module:
   - **FileException**:
     - Represents exceptions related to file operations.
     - Attributes:
       - `message`: Error message.
     - Methods:
       - `getMessage()`: Retrieves the error message.

#### 3. Interfaces:
   - Define interfaces for file operations to allow for different implementations (e.g., using standard library, platform-specific APIs).

#### 4. Dependency Inversion:
   - Use dependency inversion to decouple higher-level modules (e.g., application logic) from lower-level modules (e.g., file system operations).

#### 5. Clean Architecture:
   - Separate business logic from infrastructure details.
   - Keep high-level policies and low-level details separate.
   - Ensure that each module has clear responsibilities and boundaries.

### Notes:
- Each class follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by encapsulating a single functionality.
- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is achieved by defining interfaces for file operations and allowing different implementations.
- Error handling is centralized in the Error Handling Module to ensure consistency across the application.

This system level design provides a solid foundation for implementing basic file operations in C++ while adhering to object-oriented principles and clean architecture.
